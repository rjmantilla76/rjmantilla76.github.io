    "description": "JSON in the BigO was born in a time of raging changes in the world of technology; several countries have taken the lead on innovation while some have been relegated to consumers. In Colombia, homeland of this project, the minister of technology declared in 2014: 'We have a giant shortage of engineers in the world of IT. Between now and 2018 we will have shortage of 93 000 new software, systems and computer engineers'. As colombian system engineering students who experience this lack of interest in the field everyday, we realized that beyond employment statistics, the problem is that while youth and students are educated in natural and social sciences, mathematics and arts, the emphasis given to Engineering and Computer Science is very limited and exclusive to some institutions. The value proposition leans towards offering an efficient method of teaching the skills of algorithms and problem solving. This allows students to have an early approach to this type of challenge and break the ever present “it’s for geniuses” prejudice. The project turns to Gamification strategies to help reach its target population. The value proposition includes a narrative, aesthetic and a world that generates empathy with the audience. The fact that JSON in the Big O is a video game is part of its differentiating factor and allows it to get closer to its audience.",
