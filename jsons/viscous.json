    "description": "In a course in Scientific Computing a Visualization we analyzed a complex data set trying to depict simulations of viscous fingering. Theses simulations tried to exhibit the behavior in which high viscosity fluids interact with low viscosity ones. The project managed to infer some topological data to exhibit level surfaces of the fingers.",
